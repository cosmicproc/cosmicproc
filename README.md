## Hi there 👋

I am a computer enthusiast who is passionate about tech.

- 🔭 I’m currently exploring statistics, data science, and machine learning.
- 🌐 I'm familiar with web development from personal projects and self-study.
- 📁 My archived repositories are projects that I developed for learning and experimentation.
- 💫 I am a member of [Dechirp](https://dechirp.com) which is a name under which we publish some interesting projects we made with friends.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a process running in the cosmos. Stars denote 1, blackholes 0!
